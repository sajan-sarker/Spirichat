      "Content: held by tribal cultures around the world. The appearance of spirits of the dead plays a role in rituals and beliefs among native North and South Americans. In some South American tribes, the dead appear as guardian spirits to medicine men and shamans. The ancient Hebrews, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans believed that the souls of the dead could return to haunt the living. The Roman scholar Pliny the Younger recorded the case of a Greek philosopher who moved into a haunted house. An apparition appeared wearing chains and led the philosopher to a spot where an excavation later revealed a skeleton in chains (see ATHENODORUS, HAUNTING OF). During the Dark Ages, people believed in all manner of apparitions, usually frightful: DEMONS, VAMPIRES, and spectral creatures such as BLACK DOGS (see also BLACK SHUCK; WHISHT HOUNDS) and wild huntsmen (see HERNE THE HUNTER; WILD HUNT). By the Middle Ages, beliefs in ghosts were manipulated by the Christian church, which\n",

These spirits, often associated with old houses and graveyards, may manifest as annoying habits (knocking, running faucets, movement of small objects) or as lighted balls or mists. If a witness to such activity recognizes facial features, the ghost has become an apparition, according to the Warrens. Inhuman, demonic inﬂ uences, however, are not earthbound and do not require human energy or light for manifestation. Evil incarnations, they attempt to overpower their victims through a regimen of physical, mental, and emotional abuse. The Warrens stressed that God does not let evil visit humans, but that humans must in some way invite the malevolence into their lives: by toying with the supernatural (conjuring, TALKING BOARDS; SEANCES, black WITCHCRAFT, and Satanic rituals); by sinking into\n",

      "Content: ghosts are a way that the living retain connection with the dead and the past—we cocreate an experience with the dead and with energy of place. Some ghosts involve intensely personal experiences, such as a visit from a departed loved one. These may be one-time-only experiences, but can have a profound impact. The ﬁ elds of dreamwork, after-death communications, electronic voice phenomena, instrumental transcommunication, and survival research are exploring these experiences. Some hauntings are also populated by nonhuman entities. I do believe in spirits attached to place, such as belong to the nature realm—the elementals and fairies. There are also demonic entities that linger in places and become attached to people. Angels can haunt a place as well. We usually don’t associate angels with hauntings, but their anchored presences in holy places, such as wells, springs, and shrines with healing properties, have been recorded since ancient times.\n",
